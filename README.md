# Project Overview
The React Dark/Light Mode Checklist System is an interactive web application that allows users to manage and view a checklist while toggling between a dark and light theme. The app is built with React and utilizes styled-components for custom styling and theming. It includes responsive layouts and various modern CSS techniques to ensure a great user experience across multiple devices.

# Features
* Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Switches the theme between dark and light mode based on user preferences.
* Responsive Design: Automatically adjusts the layout for different screen sizes using media queries.
* Interactive Checklist: Displays a list of items with the ability to toggle between different themes.
* Styled Components: Utilizes styled-components for scoped and dynamic styling based on props (e.g., toggle for dark/light modes).
* Modern React Practices: Uses functional components and hooks for managing state and lifecycle methods.
  
# Technologies Used
* React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* styled-components: Library for writing CSS in JavaScript and applying dynamic styles based on props.
* Media Queries: For responsive design, adjusting layout based on screen size.
* Flexbox: Used for layout and alignment of elements in the app.

# Usage
Upon running the app, users are greeted with a checklist that allows them to toggle between dark and light themes using the "Toggle" button. The following components are rendered:
* Header: Contains the "Checklist System" title and the toggle button.
* ListContainer: Displays the list of checklist items.
* ListItem: Displays individual checklist items with dynamic background colors based on the theme.

 Users can interact with the app by switching between dark and light modes, and the layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes.
